# Different usage examples

pynxtools-em and exemplar customizations of the NOMAD research data management system provide examples how different types of electron microscopy data can be standardized and worked with.

The examples cover different techniques and have different technical depth and coverage:

* Electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD, Kikuchi diffraction in the scanning electron (SEM) or transmission electron microscope (TEM). This example offers both a broad in format coverage and technical deep standardization of EBSD datasets that has been tested with thousands of datasets from research groups across the globe.


!!! info "This is something that is good to note."

* Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) - this example offers a broad in format generic implementation for visualizing EDS mappings.
* Different imaging modes - this example offers a broad in format generic implementation for visualizing electron microscopy images that have been taken with either SEM or TEM instruments using different imaging modes.
