- alias: Following the idea of McStas that the z-axis points along the beam, electron microscopy as a beam line to study electron/matter interaction.
    type: cartesian
    handedness: right_handed
    xaxis_direction: Direction 1 that is perpendicular to the z_direction for a right_handed cartesian
    xaxis_alias: x-axis
    yaxis_direction: Direction 2 that is perpendicular to the xaxis_direction and the z_direction for a right_handed cartesian
    yaxis_alias: y-axis
    zaxis_direction: Direction of an electron travelling hypothetically exactly along the optical axis towards the specimen
    zaxis_alias: Ideal beam direction
    origin: E.g. a characteristic point along electron-optical setup such as the point where the probe exits what is considered as the gun (source).
