                  Counter-clockwise is equivalent to a right-handed choice.

                  The most frequently used convention is zxz which is based on
                  the work of H.-J. Bunge. Using other conventions is possible

              Details about the processing_reference_frame.
              Often processing can lead to cases where external stimuli are not homogeneously and isotropically
              applied to a sample. This can cause anisotropies of material properties at the coarsest level
              (typically the bulk sample). The classical example is cold-rolling where one has to specify how
              specific processing directions (rolling, transverse, and normal) align with the direction of the
              base vectors of the sample_reference_frame.
              The sample_reference_frame has coordinates Xp, Yp, Zp.

                  Keep in mind that the gnomonic space is in virtually all cases embedded in the detector space.
                  Specifically, the XgYg plane is defined such that it is laying inside the XdYd plane
                  (of the detector_reference_frame).
                  When the normalization direction is the same as e.g. the detector x-axis direction,
                  we state that we effectively normalize as fractions of the width of the detector.
                  The issue with terms like width and height is that these degenerate if the detector
                  region-of-interest has a square shape.
                  This is why we should better avoid talking about width and height but programmatically state
                  how we measure distances practically with a ruler and what we count as positive values.
