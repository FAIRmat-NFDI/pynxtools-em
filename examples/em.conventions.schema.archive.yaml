                  the coordinate system here is used to define the surface which the electron beam scans.

                  Keep in mind that the gnomonic space is in virtually all cases embedded in the detector space.
                  Specifically, the XgYg plane is defined such that it is laying inside the XdYd plane
                  (of the detector_reference_frame).
                  When the normalization direction is the same as e.g. the detector x-axis direction,
                  we state that we effectively normalize as fractions of the width of the detector.
                  The issue with terms like width and height is that these degenerate if the detector
                  region-of-interest has a square shape.
                  This is why we should better avoid talking about width and height but programmatically state
                  how we measure distances practically with a ruler and what we count as positive values.

              # Other packages describe the PC position starting from the bottom left
              # of the EBSP instead of the top left as used here. These packages may record
              # this with respect to a square/circular EBSP, illustrating that care must be
              # taken when using rectangular screens, as the aspect ratio of the EBSP is
              # important when converting pattern fractions into effective pixels or mm.
