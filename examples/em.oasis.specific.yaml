coordinate_system:
  alias: Following the idea of McStas that the z-axis points along the beam
  type: cartesian
  handedness: right_handed
  xaxis_direction: Direction 1 that is perpendicular to the z_direction for a right_handed cartesian
  xaxis_alias: rolling direction (RD)
  yaxis_direction: Direction 2 that is perpendicular to the xaxis_direction and the z_direction for a right_handed cartesian
  zaxis_direction: Direction of an electron travelling hypothetically exactly along the optical axis
  origin: E.g. a characteristic point along electron-optical setup
