"""Functionalities for batch processing data."""

# data should be stored in projects under some home directory
# a batch queue processes projects in this HOME directory based on
# a single coordinating OpenOffice sheet is used to inject
# additional ELN-style "missing" data and configure the projects parsed
# during this processing technology-partner specific content,
# e.g., nion, JEOL, Zeiss, stuff is parsed using pynxtools-em to generate
# one NeXus/HDF5 file per project
